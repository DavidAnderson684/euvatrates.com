EU VAT Rates Web Service
==============

See the website at https://euvatrates.com for all information about this project.

## Usage

You can simply request `https://euvatrates.com/rates.json` to load the data, or you can self-host the information by cloning the repository. The project is also on Bower if that's your thing: `bower install euvatrates.com`

## Contributing

Simply send a pull request! For changes to `rates.json` include the source for the change in the commit message, and also add it to the Data Sources list in `index.html` if it's a new resource.

If you're not sure if a different pull request is in line with my idea about the project, please open an issue for discussion.
